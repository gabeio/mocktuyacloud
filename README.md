# Mock Tuya Cloud
Intended to eventually be a general purpose framework for interacting with Tuya devices without the Tuya operated cloud. You can take control of your devices, prevent data leak, and unlock the full potential of your hardware.

Development has stalled as [tuya-convert](https://github.com/ct-Open-Source/tuya-convert) has become the primary option for custom firmware flashing (and I don't have any Tuya firmware running on a real device anymore!).

Feel free to take part either by applying any part of this code to your project or by submitting code, logs, feedback, suggestions, data back my way

## Work in progress! Please do not use this unless you really know what you are doing. You can break things with this! That's on you

## TODO
- [ ] learn to organize
- [ ] move specific use cases into an examples folder
- [ ] refactor device-info
- [ ] more thanks
- [ ] flesh out todo list
- [ ] add appropriate license(s) and cite borrowed code
